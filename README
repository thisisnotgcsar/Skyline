### Directory Structure
This is the project's directory and files structure and it's meaning:  
(Bolded directories contain a "Makefile" to be run before any test)

-   /: root directory
    -   **./datafiles/**: datafile's directory for the inputs
    -   **./src/**: source's directory
    -   ./results/: processed datafile's output directory
    -   script.sh: BASH script utility tool for easy deployment and test
    -   Report.pdf: The report
    -   README: This file

### Compiling
For compiling you have two options:
###### 1: Make 
In both ./datafiles/ and ./src/ direcotries there is a Makefile.  
Run:
    $ Make -C ./datafiles/
    $ Make -C ./src/
To automatically compile executables and create input datafiles to use.
###### 2: script.sh
``script.sh`` is a versatile utility script made to help you deploy and test this project.
To only compile and create files in both ./datafiles/ and ./results run:
    $ ./script.sh -c
Or:
    $ ./script.sh --compile-only
>   **N.B.**: script.sh will always run ``make`` in both directories  before anything else to be sure he is testing with up-to-date sources and input files.
