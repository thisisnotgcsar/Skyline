This directory contains some example inputs that can be used with the
program skyline.c. The inputs can be generated using the included Makefile,
which uses the "rbox" command (part of the qhull-bin package).

If desired, you can generate additional inputs to verify your program
or to perform scalability tests by modifying the number of points.

The file inputgen.c generates an input that represents the worst-case
scenario for the skyline algorithm (all points belong to the skyline).
Refer to the source code for more information.

DO NOT INCLUDE THIS DIRECTORY IN THE SUBMISSION! The files here take up
a lot of space, and I already have a copy, so I don't need it.
